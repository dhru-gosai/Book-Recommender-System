# Book-Recommender-System
A book recommender system using Natural Language Learning (NLP) and XGBoost classification techniques

Schools and universities use a list of textbooks for any selected topic to inform the academics, librarians, and publishers about an existing and any past reading lists that have been used. This data is often used in creating a recommendation system that informs the schools of alternative textbooks available and assist teachers in choosing new textbooks. This process is often time consuming and resource intensive when it comes to choosing a relevant book based on the subject and exploring its genres to align with the curriculums, followed by creating new teaching plans (Penguin Books Ltd., 2021).

Such an issue was addressed in the paper by leveraging the Data Science solution of Natural-Language-Processing (NLP) to create a content-based recommender system which extracts the data from open-source APIs such as Google books and Trove (Australian online library database (Trove, 2022)). 

The NLP model is fit through a machine learning (ML) algorithm Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to create a recommender system that recommends similar books based on a subject of interest.
